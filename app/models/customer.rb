#### Build the following methods on the `Customer` class
#
# - `Customer.all`
#   - should return **all** of the customer instances
# - `Customer.find_by_name(name)`
#   - given a string of a **full name**, returns the **first customer** whose full name matches
# - `Customer.find_all_by_first_name(name)`
#   - given a string of a first name, returns an **array** containing all customers with that first name
# - `Customer.all_names`
#   - should return an **array** of all of the customer full names


# - `Customer#add_review(restaurant, content, rating)`
#   - given a **restaurant object**, some review content (as a string), and a star rating (as an integer), creates a new review and associates it with that customer and restaurant.
# - `Customer#num_reviews`
#   - Returns the total number of reviews that a customer has authored
# - `Customer#restaurants`
#   - Returns a **unique** array of all restaurants a customer has reviewed
